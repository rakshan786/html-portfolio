<h1>The Best Movies According to Rakshan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Sultan</h3>
<p>This was the first movie I saw in a movie theatre that's why it is one of my favourites.<br>
I am a fan of Salman khan also that's the second reason.</p>
<h3>Pathan</h3>
<p>Best movie of SRK I have ever watched.<br>
Gives revival to the whole bollywood.</p>
<h3>Dangal</h3>
<p>Amir khan played a very tough role in this movie and I like his dedicaton and acting skills.<br>
This movie made highest profits at the box office in the history of Indian cinema.</p>
